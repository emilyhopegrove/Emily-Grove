              <pre>
              Hackbright Project:
                What to wear based on the weather is a simple to use app that allows the user to quickly see some suggestions for outfits to wear based on their local weather conditions. 

                The inspiration for this project was Emily simply solving her own problem â€“ never knowing what to wear one day to the next with the wild weather swings in Texas. 

                All the user has to do is create their account including their zip code/s for their home and work areas, they add in garments to their profile and the algorithm does the rest! 

                This app is destined to hit the app stores for you to use on your phone in the future. It will have new features including a random outfit generator, a save my favorite outfit function, and one day a chance to upload images of your own clothes so you can get really personalized suggestions for what to wear based on your local weather conditions.
